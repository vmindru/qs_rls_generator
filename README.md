## Getting Started 

Code can be executed locally or as Lambda. [AWS Credentials](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html) are managed standard way.
To run the lambda define following `ENV_VARS` with following DEFAULTS if ENV_VAR is not set. 

[Using AWS Lambda environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html)


List of Variables to preconfigure 
```
OWNER_TAG = 'cid_users'
BUCKET_NAME = 'NO DEFAULT' # Bucket where to upload the code
QS_REGION = 'QS region'
export MANAGEMENT_ACCOUNT_IDS='coma seaprated value of account_ids'
export MANAGMENTROLENAME=WA-Lambda-Assume-Role-Management-Account  #  Role to Assume in every payer/management account
TMP_RLS_FILE = '/tmp/cid_rls.csv'
```
## Defining TAGS

1) Tags at root OU level, Give full access to all data and overwrite any other rules for user at other levels.
2) Tags at OU level will be Inherited TAG to all children accounts.
2) Tags at Account level will be generated rules for Account level.


## Output 

Output is writen to `TMP_RLS_FILE` location and uploaded to `BUCKET_NAME`.
